# Data-Wrangling
Data wrangling is the process of cleaning, transforming, and mapping data from one format or structure to another. This process is necessary because real-world data is often messy, inconsistent, and lacks the structure required for analysis and modeling.

## The key steps in data wrangling include:

- Assessing data: This step involves exploring the data to identify issues such as missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting, and incorrect data types.

- Cleaning data: This step involves fixing the issues identified in the assessment step, such as filling in missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types.

- Transforming data: This step involves reshaping the data into a format suitable for analysis and modeling, such as aggregating the data, joining multiple datasets, and creating new features.

- Storing data: This step involves saving the cleaned and transformed data in a format suitable for future use, such as a database, a file, or a data lake.

Data wrangling is a critical step in the data science process and is often the most time-consuming and labor-intensive part of the process. However, by automating and streamlining the data wrangling process, data scientists can spend more time on analysis and modeling and get more accurate results.
